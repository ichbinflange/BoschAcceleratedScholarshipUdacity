Introduction
In this project, you will build a neural network of your own design to evaluate the CIFAR-10 dataset.

To meet the requirements for this project, you will need to achieve an accuracy greater than 45%. If you want to beat Detectocorp's algorithm, you'll need to achieve an accuracy greater than 70%. (Beating Detectocorp's algorithm is not a requirement for passing this project, but you're encouraged to try!)

Some of the benchmark results on CIFAR-10 include:

78.9% Accuracy | Deep Belief Networks; Krizhevsky, 2010

90.6% Accuracy | Maxout Networks; Goodfellow et al., 2013

96.0% Accuracy | Wide Residual Networks; Zagoruyko et al., 2016

99.0% Accuracy | GPipe; Huang et al., 2018

98.5% Accuracy | Rethinking Recurrent Neural Networks and other Improvements for ImageClassification; Nguyen et al., 2020

Research with this dataset is ongoing. Notably, many of these networks are quite large and quite expensive to train.
